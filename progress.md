# Project Status

Date: 2026-04-12

Current milestone: the enhancement roadmap summarized in `release-note-v2.md` has shipped.

## Current State

- File-tool robustness and subagent orchestration work from the 2026-04-12 enhancement baseline is complete.
- Follow-up fixes from `review.md` have been applied for cooperative stop handling and local TypeScript post-edit diagnostics.
- The Go runtime no longer auto-creates planner task-list or implementation-plan artifacts before the model explicitly saves them.
- Tool-capable implementation turns now auto-continue once when the model stalls in unnecessary clarification instead of using available tools.
- The TUI compact warning threshold now mirrors the engine for small-context models instead of warning from an effective zero threshold.
- Provider stream adapters now stop reading immediately after a terminal stop event instead of waiting for the transport to close, preventing turns from hanging in Responding after the model has already finished.
- There is no active execution baseline at the moment.
- The post-ship review findings are tracked in `review.md`.

## Planning Note

- The old phase-by-phase execution tracker has been retired.
- If a new milestone starts, create a fresh plan and progress tracker instead of extending the archived 2026-04-12 roadmap.
